 Yet an other operating system :)
 
 I have seen some guys writing there own operating system and I wanted to chalenge myself too :)
 
 So I dit it :)
 
 The source code is public in hope it will help other people writing there own and enderstand how operating system works 
 
 As it is some times hard to find goods recourses about operating systems development I will list all the ressources I found and I used to create this OS

 This is the main site for those who want to create and/or enderstand how os works. I have literally spends nights and days reading articles from this web site. My main gool was to enderstand how operating system works

 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43180/what-are-some-resources-for-getting-started-in-operating-system-development
 
 But also a lot more just search and you will find some answer or some beggining of answers :)
 
 The intel develloper manual is also a great tool ask google and you will find it
 
 And so on. Many more by browsing the web that I can't remember now 
 
 Remember that creating an OS is an hard task and you will have to spend times to success and have a lot of patience because of course you will have bugs
 
 Remember Rome wasn't build in one day :)
